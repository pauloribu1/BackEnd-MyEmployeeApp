#_MyEmployee Management Application This is a simple Employee Management application built with Spring Boot for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application allows users to manage employee records, including adding, viewing, and deleting employees. Admin users can also manage address types and employee addresses.

Features Employee Management: Add, view, and delete employee records. Photo Upload: Allows employees to upload a profile photo. Address Management: Admin users can manage address types and link addresses to employees. Responsive Design: User-friendly interface that adapts to both desktop and mobile screens. Tech Stack Backend: Spring Boot, Java 17, JPA (Hibernate) Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Fetch API Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL database) Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication Version Control: Git, GitHub Getting Started Prerequisites Java 17+ Supabase Account (used for the database) Maven (for building the Spring Boot application) Clone the repository bash Copiar código git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myemployee.git cd myemployee Setting up the backend with Supabase Create a Supabase project:

Go to Supabase and create an account. Create a new project and set up a PostgreSQL database. Configure Supabase credentials:

After setting up your Supabase project, get your database connection string and API keys. Update the application.properties (or application.yml) file in src/main/resources/ with your Supabase database connection credentials. Example:

properties Copiar código spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://your-project-id.supabase.co:5432/postgres spring.datasource.username=your-supabase-username spring.datasource.password=your-supabase-password Build and run the Spring Boot application:

bash Copiar código mvn clean install mvn spring-boot:run The backend should now be running at http://localhost:8080.

Setting up the frontend Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. The frontend communicates with the backend through the REST API and should work without additional configuration. Accessing the application To view employees, visit http://localhost:8080/employees. To add an employee, use the Add Employee form. Admin users can manage address types and link addresses to employees. API Endpoints Employee Endpoints GET /employee: Retrieve a list of all employees. POST /employee/add: Add a new employee.
